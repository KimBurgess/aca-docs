## What is it?

*ACAEngine* is a platform for extending the user experience to the built environment. It is:
- **Software only** built on the modern web
- **Open source** continuously improved and backed by a full-time team of developers
- **Extensible** able to run stand-alone, or integrated into staff, building or third party apps
- **Scalable** from rooms, to buildings, to campuses
- **Distributed** multi-node replication for live backup and fail-over
- **Secure** audit-able interaction with the physical environment and encrypted device communication
- **Insightful** integrates with [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) and [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) to provide usage metrics for physical environments

It handles the low level device communication, system management and connection with user interfaces so that you can focus on how these combine to create intuitive, modern, connected environments.

?> If you've used traditional, hardware-based control systems before, welcome to the new world.
