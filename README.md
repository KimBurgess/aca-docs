# ACA Projects Developer Guide

Looking for the docs? View the pretty version over at https://developer.acaprojects.com.


## Off-line Access

After visiting the [ACA developer guide](https://developer.acaprojects.com) with a modern browser, it will continue to load off-line. Magic.

You can also find the plain text content in [docs/](docs/) if you'd like to go old-school and print with your favourite dot-matrix printer.


## Contributing

If there's something that doesn't make sense, please spin up an issue. Or, if you've spotted an error, omission or general slip of stupidity, we <3 PR's. To keep it simple, once you have the repo enable live reload with:

```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
docsify serve .
```
