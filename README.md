# ACA Engine

> A web-based platform to control your building.


## What is it?

*ACA Engine* is a platform for extending the user experience to the built environment. It is:
- **Software only** built on the modern web
- **Open source** continuously improved and backed by a full-time team of developers
- **Extensible** able to run stand-alone, or integrated into staff, building or organisation-specific apps
- **Scalable** from rooms, to buildings, to campuses
- **Secure** provides audit-able interaction with the physical environment and encrypted device communication
- **Traceable** integrates with [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) and [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) to provide insights on how spaces are used

It handles the low level device communication, system management and connection with user interfaces so that you can focus on how these should be combined to create intuitive, modern, connected environments.

?> If you've used traditional, hardware based control systems before, you'll feel right at home.
